                                Welcome to the NoteBlockchain Foundation
                            </h2>
                            <p>The Note Foundation was created by Note's founder Ethan Shen to bring
                                together a group of trusted individuals that will help grow the project.
                                The Foundation will work ethically, honestly and with full transparency
                                to the community. </p>
                            <p>Ethan, while not a member himself, selected initial members based on
                                participation with the project and qualifications, however the Foundation
                                is not a closed group, new members can be added when nominated and voted
                                in by existing members with a 75% approval.
                                Even though the group can add new members it will not be more than 8.
                            </p>
                            <p>Members can also be removed from the group for misconduct, non participation,
                                disruption, resignation or acting against the interests of the project.
                            </p>
